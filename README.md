# Student Performance Predictor
This project aims to predict student performance using Python and machine learning. 

The project uses a dataset of student performance data, which includes information such as student grades, attendance records, and standardized test scores and machine learning algorithms to train a model that can predict student performance. 

The project is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for educators and students.
